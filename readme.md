#Spotify and ToDo emotion matcher

This project consists of 3 modules:

* EmotionMatcher (main module)
* Spotify song selector
* ToDoList Task Picker

##Basic Idea

The User selects his emotion levels via a frontend (probably using a matrix or sliders)
and the EmotionMatcher service calls the Spotify song selector and the ToDoList
task picker, to pick an appropriate song and a task based on the users emotion levels.
